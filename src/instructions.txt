How to use the Enigma Machine

1. Select your desired rotor settings
You can click on the left and right buttons of each rotor to change their position.

2. Type your message

3. Write down the cipher text and give it to a friend without 
   telling them which rotor settings you used.

4. Let them attempt to decode your message by typing the cipher text with random rotor positions. 

( Optional )
Tell your friend what rotor settings you started with to allow them to decrypt and read 
your message. To decode the message set the rotors back to the settings you used before you started 
typing and type in the cipher text.
